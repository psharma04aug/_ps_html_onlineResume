            <h4>Brampton, Ontario, Canada <a href="./_public/contact.html">Contact Me</a> </h4>
            <h5>Controls Engeering Specialist (stamping operations)</h5>
            
            <!--About-->
            <p>
                <h4>Responsibilities:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Design, Developing, Testing, and Implementing Control Systems for various industrial applications focused on the stamping industry.</li>
                    <li>Leading and supervising a team of controls engineers and technicians, providing guidance, feedback, and training.</li>
                    <li>Managing project budgets, schedules, and deliverables, ensuring quality standards and customer satisfaction.</li>
                    <li>Troubleshooting and resolving complex technical issues related to control systems, hardware, software, and networks.</li>
                    <li>Researching and evaluating new technologies and trends in the field of control engineering.</li>
                    <li>Collaborating with other engineers, managers, vendors, and clients to ensure successful project completion.</li>
                </ul> 
                <h4>Projects:</h4> 
                Lead a team that has designed and implemented a Press Health Monitoring System for stamping machines, which is an approach to reduce unplanned downtime in the stamping industry. You used open-source technologies, such as react-based UI, MQTT, Node-Red, and OPC/UA, to create a system that can predict machine faults beforehand. Eliminated the need for a PLC and used an NVIDIA high-speed controller to collect data from the machines. Experienced with MongoDB for data collection system as back-end. Worked together with a data engineering team to develop deep learning algorithms for predictive features. You collaborated with over 30 suppliers to bring down the system cost to less than $30K. You created a system that can compete with 3rd party suppliers such as FLUKE, and Rockwell, with predictions of up to 95% accuracy.
                Some of the numerous projects include the designing and implementation of an in-house control system for multiple systems used on presses or stamping machines. Designed the electrical panel based on industry standards and PHSR. Designed and developed the motion and safety programming in-house.
                Have experience in leading teams of millwrights and electricians to maintain over 10 presses for a smoother operational process.
                Experienced in implementing a team of "Tech-Leads", who are responsible for operations and maintaining the health of presses and their tool and dies. First of its kind in the stamping industry to bridge the gap of operations and technical teams.
